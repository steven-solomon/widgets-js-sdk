# 0.2.4

Provide more robust 'navigate' message handling. If a browser stops a new tab from being opend via
window.open in response to a 'navigate' message, then the window.location.href will be set instead.

# 0.2.3

Tweaked logic around setting widget height, specifically to take into account differences between browsers determining heights differently.

Credit also due to @pborshchahivskyi for investigating original issue and proposing use of window.innerHeight.

# 0.2.2

[jQuery.noConflict()](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/) call now removes all jQuery variables from global scope to prevent conflict with pages that already include a separate version of jQuery.

# 0.2.1

Dispatch now handles `host:request` events that request properties on host page whose values should be returned to the originating widget iframe.

# 0.2.0

This is a major version update in the sense that a lot of files were changed to support the global object rename from `CT` to `CrowdTwist` to avoid collisions with third-party libraries, therefore it is not backwards compatible with previous versions.

Other than the rename, no changes in functionality are introduced with this release.

# 0.1.1

- **[Fix](https://github.com/CrowdTwist/widgets-js-sdk/commit/4ad15eed38a93d71b2e6c6d4a47747a5ca2c7640)** - Scrolling issue where two scrollbars would appear due to max height feature. Now, only extra scroll bar will appear in modals when not enough vertical space is available in the viewport.

# 0.1.0

This is the first major release to go live and features the following changes:

- **Bootstrap** - When the SDK is included on a page featuring one or more widget tags (identified by the `ct-widget` **class**), it will convert the tags into iframes representing the configured functionality, such as a list of rewards or a survey. This process kicks off when the DOM is fully loaded.

- **Widget** - Handles communications between the host page and the iframe, ensuring dynamic resizing of height as well as visibility on the page. A widget can currently raise 2 events that affect the user experience on the host page:
  - `modal:open` - Opens a modal on the host page.
  - `navigate` - Opens a new tab / popup to an external url.

- **Modal** - 2 elements will be inserted into the host page for proper rendering of modals:
  - `<div id="ct-modal">` - The container responsible for rendering the actual widget.
  - `<div id="ct-modal-background">` - For a disabled, dimmed background.

- **Event** - By using `CT.Event.subscribe()`, the host page can listen on various events raised by widgets, responding to actions like a user logging in.

_Additional:_

- Verbose debugging in the console can be turned on by setting the global `CT_DEBUG` JavaScript property to `true`.
- If lacking the responsive `<meta>` viewport tag, host page will have one set automatically when displaying a modal for optimal rendering on mobile devices.
